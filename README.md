-------------------

This short script aims to demonstrate my basic coding prodiciency by completing the following exercise:

	A robot on a grid has starting position (0,0). 

	The robot can be given instructions to move a given number of steps up, down, left, or right. 
	Write a function that takes in a list of instructions and outputs the distance (in a straight line) 
	the robot is from its starting position. The distance should be rounded to the nearest integer.
	The instructions are given as a single array of directions followed by a number of steps to be taken 
	in that direction.

	example input:
		[“UP 5”, “DOWN 3”, “LEFT 3”, “RIGHT 2”, “UP 2”, “LEFT 1”]
	output:
		4

NOTE : I assumed the grid to be a Cartesian plane.
